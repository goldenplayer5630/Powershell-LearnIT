### Assignment: **CSV Data Analysis**
Difficulty: Advanced
**Objective:**
Create a PowerShell script that analyzes data from a CSV file. This assignment will cover CSV file handling, basic data analysis, and presentation of results.

**Requirements:**

1. **CSV File Handling:**
    - Assume you have a CSV file containing information about students, including columns like "Name," "Age," "Grade," and "Subject."
    - Create a PowerShell script that reads the data from the CSV file.

2. **Data Analysis:**
    - Write functions to perform the following analyses:
        - Calculate the average age of students.
        - Determine the highest and lowest grades in each subject.
        - Count the number of students in each grade.

3. **Presentation of Results:**
    - Display the calculated results to the user in a clear and organized format.

4. **User Interaction:**
    - Allow the user to choose which analysis to perform.
    - Provide an option to display the raw data from the CSV file.

**Example Output:**
```powershell
Welcome to CSV Data Analysis!

Choose an operation:
1. Calculate Average Age
2. Analyze Grades by Subject
3. Count Students by Grade
4. Display Raw Data

Enter your choice (1-4): 2

Subject: Math
Highest Grade: 98
Lowest Grade: 65

Subject: English
Highest Grade: 92
Lowest Grade: 70
...
```

**Extra Challenge (Optional):**
- Implement additional analyses based on the data in the CSV file (e.g., calculate the overall average grade, find the most common age).

**Submission:**
Submit your well-documented PowerShell script along with a sample CSV file and an explanation of the analyses performed. Discuss any additional features you implemented and how you handled potential issues with the CSV file. This assignment is designed to reinforce PowerShell scripting skills with practical data analysis scenarios.
